Understanding how ONTAP Cloud uses cloud storage can help you understand your storage costs.

toc::[]

== Overview

ONTAP Cloud uses AWS and Azure volumes as back-end storage. It sees these volumes as disks and groups them into one or more aggregates. Aggregates provide storage to one or more ONTAP Cloud volumes.

image:diagram_storage.png[This illustration shows an aggregate that is comprised of EBS disks, and the data volumes that ONTAP Cloud makes available to hosts.]

In AWS, an aggregate can contain up to 6 disks, with a maximum disk size of 16 TB. The underlying disk type can be a single EBS storage type or a tiered storage configuration that includes an EBS performance tier and an S3 capacity tier.

In Azure, an aggregate can contain up to 12 disks, with a maximum disk size of 4 TB. The underlying Azure managed disk type can be either Standard Storage (HDD) or Premium Storage (SSD).

You choose the disk type and the default disk size when you deploy an ONTAP Cloud system.

TIP: The total amount of storage purchased from AWS or Azure is the _raw capacity_. The _usable capacity_ is less because approximately 12 to 14 percent is overhead that is reserved for ONTAP Cloud use. For example, if Cloud Manager creates a 500 GB aggregate, the usable capacity is 442.94 GB.

== Storage tiering overview

With ONTAP Cloud for AWS, you can reduce your storage costs by using EBS as a performance tier and AWS S3 as a capacity tier.

A tiered storage configuration is a good choice if your data changes frequently or if you use ONTAP Cloud for disaster recovery or long-term retention:

* After an aggregate has reached 50% capacity, ONTAP Cloud tiers Snapshot copies of read-write volumes to cost-effective S3 storage, freeing up the EBS performance tier for "hot" data.

* When you replicate a volume to a tiered storage configuration for disaster recovery or long-term retention, data for the destination volume resides in the S3 capacity tier.
+
If you activate the destination volume, the data gradually moves to the EBS performance tier as it is read.

Note the following about the EBS and S3 tiers:

* An ONTAP Cloud system's capacity limit is spread across EBS and S3 storage.

* The EBS tier can be General Purpose SSDs or Throughput Optimized HDDs.

* An ONTAP Cloud working environment uses a single S3 bucket for tiered storage. This includes an HA working environment.

* Cloud Manager creates the S3 bucket and names it fabric-pool-_cluster unique identifier_.

NOTE: You do not need to install a feature license to enable storage tiering.

=== Connection requirement for storage tiering

Before you choose a tiered storage configuration, you must ensure that ONTAP Cloud has a connection to S3. The best way to provide that connection is by creating a VPC Endpoint to the S3 service.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpce-gateway.html#create-gateway-endpoint[AWS Documentation: Creating a Gateway Endpoint^]

For additional information, see link:reference_networking_aws.html[AWS networking requirements].

=== Setting up a tiered storage configuration

After you create a VPC Endpoint to S3, you can choose a tiered storage configuration when you create an ONTAP Cloud volume and when you replicate data. The following image shows the S3 Tiering option when creating a new volume:

Cloud Manager creates the S3 bucket for you.

=== Configurations supported with storage tiering

Storage tiering is supported with specific configurations and features:

* Storage tiering is supported with ONTAP Cloud Standard, Premium, and BYOL.
+
It is not supported with ONTAP Cloud Explore or with M3 and R3 instance types when using Standard and Premium.

* Storage tiering is supported with AWS-managed encryption.
+
It is not supported with ONTAP Cloud-managed encryption.

* Thin provisioning must be enabled on volumes that use a tiered storage configuration.

* ONTAP performance enhancements introduced in ONTAP Cloud 9.2 are not supported with tiered storage configurations.
