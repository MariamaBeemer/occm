Getting started includes preparing your AWS environment, launching the OnCommand Cloud Manager software from NetApp Cloud Central, and then launching ONTAP Cloud systems using Cloud Manager.

== Preparing your AWS environment

Before you can deploy Cloud Manager and ONTAP Cloud in AWS, you need to prepare your networking, attach an IAM policy to an IAM user, and subscribe to ONTAP Cloud from the AWS Marketplace.

.Steps

. Choose the AWS VPC and subnets in which you want to launch the Cloud Manager instance and ONTAP Cloud instances.
+
At a minimum, your networking must meet the following requirements:

* The target VPC must have one or more subnets that have outbound internet access.

* To deploy ONTAP Cloud systems in subnets or networks separate from Cloud Manager, connections between those networks must be in place.

* To replicate data across a hybrid cloud or multi-cloud environment, VPN connections between networks must be in place.
+
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/SetUpVPNConnections.html[AWS Documentation: Setting Up an AWS VPN Connection^]

* To reduce storage costs by using EBS as a performance tier and AWS S3 as a capacity tier, the VPC in which you launch ONTAP Cloud must have an endpoint to the S3 service.
+
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-endpoints.html[AWS Documentation: VPC Endpoints^]

+
For additional information, see link:reference_networking_aws.html[AWS networking requirements].
The following sample VPC configuration shows public and private subnets and a NAT device that enables outbound internet access for the private subnet:
image:diagram_vpc_public_and_private.png[This illustration shows Cloud Manager and a NAT instance running in a public subnet, and ONTAP Cloud instances running in a private subnet.]

. Grant a specific set of AWS permissions to the IAM user that you plan to use when deploying Cloud Manager from the NetApp Cloud Central:

.. From the AWS IAM console, create your own policy by copying and pasting the contents of the https://mysupport.netapp.com/cloudontap/iampolicies[NetApp Cloud Central IAM policy^].

.. Attach the policy that you just created to the IAM user.
+
The following video shows this process.

. If you want to use Amazon encryption with ONTAP Cloud, then you must set up the AWS Key Management Service (KMS):

* An active CMK must exist in your account. The CMK can be an AWS-managed CMK or a customer-managed CMK.

* You must add the IAM role associated with Cloud Manager to the list of key users for a CMK. This gives Cloud Manager permissions to use the CMK with ONTAP Cloud.

. Subscribe to ONTAP Cloud in AWS:

.. Go to the AWS Marketplace pages for ONTAP Cloud:

* http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B011KEZ734[ONTAP Cloud for AWS (PayGo)^]
* http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00OMA46T0[ONTAP Cloud for AWS (BYOL)^]
* http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01H4LVJ84[ONTAP Cloud for AWS - High Availability (PayGo)^]
* http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01H4LVJUC[ONTAP Cloud for AWS - High Availability (BYOL)^]

.. Click *Continue*, review the terms, and then click *Accept Software Terms*.
+
IMPORTANT: You must not launch ONTAP Cloud instances from the AWS Marketplace. You must use Cloud Manager to launch ONTAP Cloud.

.Result

Your environment is ready to deploy Cloud Manager and ONTAP Cloud.

== Launching Cloud Manager in AWS

You need to install and set up Cloud Manager so you can use it to launch ONTAP Cloud in AWS.

.Steps

. Go to https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^] and sign up or log in.

. Under *ONTAP Cloud*, click *Start Free Trial*.

. Follow the prompts to deploy the Cloud Manager instance and software in AWS.
+
You should keep the page open until the deployment is complete. The portal redirects you to the Cloud Manager system when it is available.
+
NOTE: If a proxy server is required for internet connectivity in the subnet, Cloud Manager prompts you to add the proxy details.
+
The following video shows how to launch Cloud Manager.
+

.Result

Cloud Manager is now installed and set up so users can launch ONTAP Cloud instances.

== Launching ONTAP Cloud in AWS

You can launch ONTAP Cloud in AWS to provide enterprise-class features for your cloud storage. You can choose a single-node configuration, or an HA pair to provide nondisruptive operations and fault tolerance in AWS.

.Steps

. On the Working Environments page in Cloud Manager, click *Create*.

. Under Create, select *ONTAP Cloud* or *ONTAP Cloud HA*.

. Complete the steps in the wizard to launch the instance.
+
Note the following as you complete the wizard:

* The predefined security group includes the rules that ONTAP Cloud needs to operate successfully.
+
If you need to use your own, refer to link:reference_security_groups.html[Security group rules].

* The underlying AWS disk type is for the initial ONTAP Cloud volume. You can choose a different disk type for subsequent volumes.

* The performance of AWS disks is tied to disk size. You should choose the disk size that gives you the sustained performance that you need.
+
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html[AWS Documentation: Amazon EBS Volume Types^]

* The disk size is the default size for all disks on the system.
+
TIP: If you need a different size later, you can use the *Advanced allocation* option to create an aggregate that uses disks of a specific size.
+
The following video shows how to launch a single-node configuration.

.Result

Cloud Manager launches the ONTAP Cloud instance in AWS. You can track the progress in the timeline.
