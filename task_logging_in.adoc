You can log in to Cloud Manager from any web browser that has a connection to the Cloud Manager system. For new Cloud Manager 3.4 systems and later, you must have a https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^] user account to log in.

.Steps

. Open a web browser and enter the following URL:
+
https://_ipaddress_:__port__
+
_ipaddress_ can be localhost, a private IP address, or a public IP address, depending on the configuration of the Cloud Manager host. For example, if Cloud Manager is in the public cloud without a public IP address, you must enter a private IP address from a host that has a connection to the Cloud Manager host.
+
_port_ is required if you changed the default HTTP (80) or HTTPS (443) ports. For example, if the HTTPS port was changed to 8443, you would enter https://ipaddress:8443
+
After you enter the URL, the Cloud Manager log in screen appears. The following image shows the log in screen for new Cloud Manager 3.4 systems and later.

. If you do not have a NetApp Cloud Central user account, you must sign up for one and then the Cloud Manager administrator must add your account to the system before you can log in.
