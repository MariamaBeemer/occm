[.lead]
You can asynchronously mirror data from a source SVM on one system to a destination SVM on an ONTAP Cloud system. This enables you to activate the destination SVM for data access if the source SVM is no longer available.

ONTAP Cloud supports one data-serving Storage Virtual Machine (SVM) and one or more SVMs used for disaster recovery.

NOTE: Cloud Manager does not provide any setup or orchestration support for SVM disaster recovery. It also does not support storage-related tasks on any additional SVMs. You must use System Manager or the CLI for SVM disaster recovery.
