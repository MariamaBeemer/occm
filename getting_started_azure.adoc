ONTAP Cloud provides enterprise-class features for your cloud storage and gives you a universal storage platform that enables you to easily replicate data across your hybrid cloud. You must launch and manage ONTAP Cloud using OnCommand Cloud Manager software.

You should use this document if you want to get Cloud Manager and ONTAP Cloud up and running quickly in Azure, and you do not want to read conceptual background and explore every available option.

== Verifying your networking
[.lead]
You must choose the Azure VNet and subnets in which you want to deploy Cloud Manager and ONTAP Cloud.

At a minimum, your networking must meet the following requirements:
[square]
* The target VNet must have one or more subnets that have outbound internet access.
* To deploy ONTAP Cloud systems in subnets or networks separate from Cloud Manager, connections between those networks must be in place.
* To replicate data across a hybrid cloud or multi-cloud environment, VPN connections between networks must be in place.

== Enabling programmatic deployments of ONTAP Cloud
[.lead]
Cloud Manager deploys ONTAP Cloud using API calls, so you must enable programmatic deployments from the Azure Marketplace.

.Steps
. Using an Azure user account that has at least the Contributor role, go to the https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/netapp/netapp-ontap-cloud/[Azure Marketplace page for ONTAP Cloud^].
. Click *Get it now*, select the PAYGo or BYOL offering, and click *Continue*.
+
image::media/azure_marketplace.gif[Shows the drop-down list that you can use to select either ONTAP Cloud PayGo or ONTAP Cloud BYOL in the Azure Marketplace.]
. From the Azure portal, click *Want to deploy programmatically?*
+
image::media/azure_programmatic.gif[Shows the Want to deploy programmatically option in Microsoft Azure.]
. Click *Enable* for each Azure subscription from which you want to deploy ONTAP Cloud.
+
image::media/azure_programmatic_enable.gif[Shows how to enable programmatic deployment for a subscription in Microsoft Azure.]
. Click *Save*.
. If you want to deploy both ONTAP Cloud BYOL and PAYGo, repeat the steps for the other offering.

== Granting Azure permissions to Cloud Manager
[.lead]
Cloud Manager needs permissions to perform actions in Azure. You must grant the required permissions by creating and setting up a service principal in Azure Active Directory and by obtaining the Azure credentials that Cloud Manager needs.

*About this task*

The following image depicts how Cloud Manager obtains permissions to perform operations in Azure. A service principal object, which is tied to an Azure subscription, represents Cloud Manager in Azure Active Directory and is assigned to a custom role that allows the required permissions.

image::media/azure_authentication.gif[Conceptual image that shows Cloud Manager obtaining authentication and authorization from Azure Active Directory before it can make an API call. In Active Directory, the Cloud Manager Operator role defines permissions. It is tied to an Azure subscription and a service principal object that represents the Cloud Manger application.]

You should perform these steps for the Azure subscriptions from which you want to deploy ONTAP Cloud systems.

NOTE: The following steps use the new Azure portal. If you experience any issues, you should use the Azure classic portal.

.Steps
. <<Creating a custom role with the required Cloud Manager permissions,Create a custom role with the required Cloud Manager permissions>>.
. <<Creating an Active Directory service principal,Create an Active Directory service principal>>.
. <<Assigning the Cloud Manager Operator role to the service principal,Assign the custom Cloud Manager Operator role to the service principal>>.
. <<Obtaining your Azure subscription ID,Obtain your Azure subscription ID>>.

=== Creating a custom role with the required Cloud Manager permissions
[.lead]
A custom role is required to provide Cloud Manager with the permissions that it needs to launch and manage ONTAP Cloud in Azure.

.Steps
. Download the https://mysupport.netapp.com/cloudontap/iampolicies[Cloud Manager Azure policy^].
. Modify the JSON file by adding Azure subscription IDs to the assignable scope.
+
You should add the ID for each Azure subscription from which users will create ONTAP Cloud systems.
+
*Example*
+
"AssignableScopes": [
"/subscriptions/d333af45-0d07-4154-943d-c25fbzzzzzzz",
"/subscriptions/54b91999-b3e6-4599-908e-416e0zzzzzzz",
"/subscriptions/398e471c-3b42-4ae7-9b59-ce5bbzzzzzzz"

. Use the JSON file to create a custom role in Azure.
+
The following example shows how to create a custom role using the Azure CLI 2.0:
+
*az role definition create --role-definition C:\Policy_for_Cloud_Manager_Azure_3.3.1.json*

*Result*
You should now have a custom role called OnCommand Cloud Manager Operator.

=== Creating an Active Directory service principal
[.lead]
You must create an Active Directory service principal so Cloud Manager can authenticate with Azure Active Directory.

*Before you begin*

You must have the appropriate permissions in Azure to create an Active Directory application and to assign the application to a role.
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal/[Microsoft Azure Documentation: Use portal to create Active Directory application and service principal that can access resources^]

.Steps
. From the Azure portal, open the *Azure Active Directory* service.
+
image::media/azure_ad.gif[Shows the Active Directory service in Microsoft Azure.]

. In the menu, click *App registrations*.
. Create the service principal:
.. Click *New application registration*.
.. Enter a name for the application, keep *Web app / API* selected, and then enter any URLâ€”for example, http://url
.. Click *Create*.
. Modify the application to add the required permissions:
.. Select the created application.
.. Under Settings, click *Required permissions* and then click *Add*.
+
image::media/azure_ad_permissions.gif[Shows the settings for an Active Directory application in Microsoft Azure and highlights the option to add required permissions for API access.]
.. Click *Select an API*, select *Windows Azure Service Management API*, and then click *Select*.
+
image::media/azure_ad_api.gif[Shows the API to select in Microsoft Azure when adding API access to the Active Directory application. The API is the Windows Azure Service Management API.]
.. Click *Access Azure Service Management as organization users*, click *Select* and then click *Done*.
. Create a key for the service principal:
.. Under Settings, click *Keys*.
.. Enter a description, select a duration, and then click *Save*.
.. Copy the key value.
+
You need to enter the key value in Cloud Manager when you create user accounts for this subscription.
.. Click *Properties* and then copy the application ID for the service principal.
+
Similar to the key value, you need to enter the application ID in Cloud Manager when you create user accounts for this subscription.
+
image::media/azure_ad_app_id.gif[Shows the application ID for an Azure Active Directory service principal.]
. Obtain the Active Directory tenant ID for your organization:
.. In the Active Directory menu, click *Properties*.
.. Copy the Directory ID.
+
image::media/azure_ad_id.gif[Shows the Active Directory properties in the Azure portal and the Directory ID that you need to copy.]
+
Just like the application ID and application key, you must enter the Active Directory tenant ID when you create Cloud Manager user accounts.

*Result*

You should now have an Active Directory service principal and you should have copied the application ID, the application key, and the Active Directory tenant ID.

=== Assigning the Cloud Manager Operator role to the service principal
[.lead]
You must bind the service principal to an Azure subscription and assign it the Cloud Manager Operator role so Cloud Manager has permissions in Azure.

.Steps
. From the Azure portal, select *Subscriptions* in the left pane.
. Select the subscription.
. Click *Access control (IAM)* and then click *Add*.
. Select the *OnCommand Cloud Manager Operator* role.
. Search for the name of the application (you cannot find it in the list by scrolling).
. Select the application, click *Select*, and then click *OK*.

*Result*

The service principal for Cloud Manager now has the required Azure permissions.

=== Obtaining your Azure subscription ID
[.lead]
Cloud Manager needs your Azure subscription ID to log in programmatically to Azure and deploy ONTAP Cloud systems.

.Steps
. In the Azure portal, select the *Subscriptions* service.
+
image::media/azure_subscriptions_menu.gif[Shows the Subscriptions menu item in the Azure portal.]
. In the Subscriptions pane, copy the ID for your subscription.
+
image::media/azure_subscription_id.gif[Shows an Azure subscription ID that is available in the Subscriptions section of the Azure portal.]

*Result*

You should now have the Azure credentials that you need to enter in Cloud Manager when you create a user account. Cloud Manager uses the credentials to deploy ONTAP Cloud in Azure on your behalf.

== Installing and setting up Cloud Manager in Azure
[.lead]
You need to install and set up Cloud Manager so you can use it to launch ONTAP Cloud in Azure.

.Steps
. Go to the https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Data Services Portal^] and sign up or log in.
. Under *ONTAP Cloud*, click *Start Free Trial*.
. Select *Microsoft Azure* to deploy Cloud Manager from the Azure Marketplace.
. Click *Get it now* and then click *Continue*.
. From the Azure portal, click *Create* and follow the steps to configure the virtual machine.
Note the following as you configure the virtual machine:
[square]
* Cloud Manager can perform optimally with either HDD or SSD disks.
* You should choose one of the recommended virtual machine sizes: A2, D1, D2, D1_v2, or D2_v2.
* It is best to keep the default selection of a new network security group. This new security group includes the required inbound and outbound rules for Cloud Manager.
. Review your selections and click *OK*.
+
*Example*
+
image::media/azure_summary.gif[Screen shot: Shows an example of the settings when deploying OnCommand Cloud Manager in Microsoft Azure.]
. Click *Purchase*.
+
Azure launches the virtual machine with the specified settings. The virtual machine and Cloud Manager software should be running in approximately five minutes.

. Open a web browser from a host that has a connection to the Cloud Manager virtual machine and enter the following URL:
http://_ipaddress_:80
+
When you log in, Cloud Manager automatically adds your user account as the administrator for this system.
. After you log in, enter a name for the Cloud Manager system.

**Result**

Cloud Manager is now installed and set up so users can deploy ONTAP Cloud in Azure.

== Deploying ONTAP Cloud in Azure
[.lead]
You can deploy ONTAP Cloud in Azure to provide enterprise-class features for your cloud storage.

.Steps

. On the Working Environments page in Cloud Manager, click *Create*.

. Under Create, select *ONTAP Cloud for Azure*.

. Complete the steps in the wizard to launch the system.
+
Note the following as you complete the wizard:
[square]
* The predefined network security group includes the rules that ONTAP Cloud needs to operate successfully.
* The underlying Azure disk type is for the initial ONTAP Cloud volume. You can choose a different disk type for subsequent volumes.
* The performance of Azure Premium Storage is tied to the disk size. Larger disks provide higher IOPS and throughput.
* The disk size is the default size for all disks on the system.
+
TIP: If you need a different size later, you can use the *Advanced allocation* option to create an aggregate that uses disks of a specific size.
