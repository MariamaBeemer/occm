If you want to install Cloud Manager in the IBM Cloud, then the environment must meet a few requirements.

NOTE: While you can install Cloud Manager in the IBM Cloud, ONTAP Cloud is not supported in the IBM Cloud.

Outbound internet access::
Cloud Manager needs outbound internet access to communicate with AWS and Azure services when deploying ONTAP Cloud, to access software images for upgrades, and to enable technical support from NetApp.
+
For details about the specific endpoints, see link:reference_networking_aws.html[AWS networking requirements] and link:reference_networking_azure.html[Azure networking requirements].

Connection between Cloud Manager and ONTAP Cloud subnets::
Cloud Manager requires a network connection to the AWS VPCs and Azure VNets in which you want to deploy ONTAP Cloud systems.

Connection to the Cloud Manager web console::
Users must access Cloud Manager from a web browser. The easiest way to provide access is by allocating a public IP address to the host. However, if you want to use a private IP address instead, users can access the console through either of the following:
+
* A jump host that has a connection to Cloud Manager

* A host in your network that has a VPN connection to the private IP address
